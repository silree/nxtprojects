NXTRockBoy is a game boy or game machine built by LEGO Mindstorms NXT 8547 kit. Rocking control is its unique feature. 

= Introduction =

In NXTRockBoy, NXT brick is connected to a servo motor so that when you rock the NXT brick the servo motor can return a angle value to the program. You can program your own game on NXTRockBoy. I think the most suitable games on NXTRockBoy are some physics simulation game. 

Below is a quick look of the NXTRockBoy body.
